## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Create `services/` and move backend folders into it.
- [ ] 1.2 Update `firebase.json` to point at the new functions source.
- [ ] 1.3 Update docs/scripts that reference the old paths (README, guides, test commands).
- [ ] 1.4 Verify local dev commands still work (frontend, backend, emulators).
- [ ] 1.5 Create `architecture.txt` with the new hierarchy using ASCII tree markers.
